# Super AKI-80 International Preservation Effort
The _Super AKI-80 International Preservation Effort_ is a personal project meant to preserve the knowledge about the Super AKI-80 microcomputer.

## Motivation
When I learned about the Super AKI-80, I was intrigued, since it is fairly different from most kit Z80 based computers. It is mostly different in the sense that it utilizes a highly integrated version of the Z80 CPU, the TOSHIBA TMPZ84C015. I was interesented in it, but most of the information I could find was written in Japanese. That is the reason I decided to put my (very limited) Japanese language and Google translate abilities to use and translate the datasheet provided by _Akizuki denshi tusho_, as well as port the schematics from images to a more useful format (thinking about using KiCad). 

## Contributing
Everyone is welcome to support this small personal project by improving and/or helping with the translation of the document, as well as with the porting of the schematic to a modern format through pull requests and issues.

It would also be helpful if you have any information about this board that is missing from the repo if you could let me know through an issue.
